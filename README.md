# ITEMS MISSING (TODO)
As a day has only so many hours there's a few items that i couldn't get done in time:
1. Send email
2. Reset password
3. Add prettier css
4. Client form for searching a contact

# Development Journal
The initial plan was to make a nodejs api with an svelte front-end. So i started with a basic crud api on top of mongodb atlas, but then i realized that making a front end client would take way too much time, then i googled for a quicker way to do this and found pug (jade), which i had to learn on the go. I learned a lot about old school HTML pages since that's more or less how this works. Before i had only worked with SPAs consuming APIs.

# Final Thoughts
This was overall a great learning experience. There's many things i would like to have done better, or different, but even then, i really like the end result. I hope you like it too.
